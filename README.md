# HarryPotterSurvey

This a survey form using JavaScript that offers up hints, uses a variety of input types, and performs basic
validation before delivering the results of the survey to the page. In order to take part in the survey, the user must input their personal information which is validated on a onBlur function. Once all of the input fields are filled and validated, the survey questions will appear for the user to answer and submit their survey. After the survey is submitted, the user will be shown their personal info,
the answers they submitted, and a “badge” with an absolute URL that they can place on their homepage.
